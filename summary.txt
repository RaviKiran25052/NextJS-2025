What is Next.js?
- Next.js is a React framework for building full-stack web applications
- React is a library for building user interfaces. It's not feasible to create a fully-featured application ready for production.
- You need to make decisions about other features such as routing, data fetching and more
- Next.js uses React for building user interfaces and provides additional features that enable you to build production-ready applications
- These features include routing, optimized rendering, data fetching, bundling, compiling, and more
- You don't need to install additional packages as Next.js provides everything you need
- Opinions and conventions should be followed to implement these features

Why learn Next.js?
Next.js simplifies the process of building production-ready web applications

1. Routing

3. Rendering
4. Data fetching
5. Styling
6. Optimization
7. Dev and prod build system

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

npx create-next-app@latest .
npm run dev

Routing conventions
1. All routes must live inside the app folder
2. Route files must be named either page.js or page.tsx
3. Each folder represents a segment of the URL path
When these conventions are followed, the file automatically becomes available as a route.
